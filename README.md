Generate the app icon using the following prompt:

```markdown
Use this prompt to generate a new icon png
```

A bold, ultra-minimalist, solid black 'om' logo on a pure solid white #FFFFFF background with monospace font. The design must be a vector-style flat shape with distinct, thick lines. No gradients, no gray, not in calligraphy style, just #000000 black and #FFFFFF white. The logo MUST be vertical and horizontal centered in the image. Highest resolution for a Mac system tray icon following macOS design guidelines. The file should be in PNG format.

```
Save the generated image at `./src-tauri/icons/tray-icon-white-path.png`

Finally run this script `node scripts/convert.ts src-tauri/icons/tray-icon-white-path.png src-tauri/icons/tray-icon-black-path.png src-tauri/icons/tray-icon.png` to covert to `tray-icon.png`
